# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv8
This repository contains a project demonstrating the training and application of a YOLOv8 model to detect and identify objects such as people, buses, backpacks, and traffic lights. The model extends beyond traditional image classification by classifying and locating objects within images using bounding boxes.

The model performs real-time object detection with high speed and accuracy, recognizing people, buses, backpacks, and traffic lights in urban scenes, and effectively identifying these objects in video footage. Applications include autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and smart city solutions.

Explore the code, dataset, and trained model to replicate the object detection process.
