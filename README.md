# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv8
This repository contains a project demonstrating the training and application of a YOLOv8 model to detect and identify objects such as people, buses, backpacks, and traffic lights. The model extends beyond traditional image classification by classifying and locating objects within images using bounding boxes.
