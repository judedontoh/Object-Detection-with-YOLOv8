# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv8
This repository contains a project demonstrating the training and application of a YOLOv8 model to detect and identify objects such as people, buses, backpacks, and traffic lights. The model extends beyond traditional image classification by classifying and locating objects within images using bounding boxes.
Features:
Real-Time Detection: Performs real-time object detection with high speed and accuracy.
Diverse Object Detection: Recognizes people, buses, backpacks, and traffic lights in urban scenes.
Video Application: Effectively identifies buses and traffic lights in video footage.
Applications:
Autonomous driving
Surveillance systems
Smart city solutions
Explore the code, dataset, and trained model to replicate the object detection process.
